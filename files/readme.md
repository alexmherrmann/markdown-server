# Lil markdown server

This is meant to be a very basic markdown server!

* go to / once you've opened it to list all markdown files
* go to /md/:file to render the file at that location
* all public files are hosted on /public
    * for example go to [main.css](/public/main.css) to see the css file for the main page
